# ESIPAP 2021 - Experimental Particle Physics

## Slides

The slides of the lectures will appear in [this directory](Slides) as the course proceeds. 

Since this year the course will be held remotely becouse  the pandemics, the PDF of the next lecture will be made available *before* the lecture itself to allow you to better follow.

## Homework

I will sometime leave things to do by yourself, either alone or in small groups, in order to consolidate what we learned during the lectures. Instructions and material will appear in the [Homework](Homework) directory.

## Tutorials

Every once in a while, we will do simple calculations and data analysis exercises. 
We will use [ROOT](https://root.cern) and [Python](https://www.python.org) with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks, that will appear in the [Tutorials](Tutorials) directory. 

You have several options to run these notebooks:

- You have a local setup version of Python3 and ROOT (with Python support enabled) installed on your computer: clone or download the repository, and run the notebooks locally.

- You know how to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com): clone or download the repository, build the `docker` image and [run it](https://hub.docker.com/r/rootproject/root), run the notebooks locally.

- You have a CERN account, and you know how to use [SWAN](http://swan.cern.ch): clone the repository on your CERNBox area to access and run the notebooks.

- If none of the above works for you, you can launch a standalone [binder](https://mybinder.org) environment using the other button below: it will give you a working setup with Python and ROOT, that will allow you to run the notebooks from the browser. Please note that in this case any change you make will be lost unless you copy them elsewhere.

**Go to the [Tutorials](Tutorials) directory and execute the [example notebook](Tutorials/TestSetup.ipynb) there to verify your setup!**

If you never used Python before, fear not! It's rather easy to get the grip of the basics. You can use the excellent [Crash Course](https://github.com/rpmuller/PythonCrashCourse) by [Rick Muller](http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~rmuller/) to get started.
